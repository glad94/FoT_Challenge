## Repository for submission to the Friends of Tracking #FoT Liverpool Analytics Challenge. 


Submitted report: **Liverpool_Challenge_FoT.pdf**

A quick walkthrough of the Last-Row data processing code and pitch control computations: **FoT_Demo_Notebook.ipynb**

Extremely messy actual notebook that I used for producing outputs that may contain occasional insults to Liverpool here and there due to coding
frustration: **explore_poo.ipynb**
